# Mushroom Classification 
Aim: Through classification modeling, this project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

Description:  In recent years, the popularity of mushrooms as a superfood and the understanding of their vast health benefits has surged. What used to be typically seen as just a traditional food, mushrooms are now being widely consumed and acknowledged for their healing and health abilities. There are thousands of species of Mushrooms in the world; they are edible and non-edible being poisonous. It is difficult for non-expertise people to Identify poisonous and edible mushrooms of all species manually. So a computer-aided system with software or algorithm is required to classify poisonous and nonpoisonous mushrooms. This project is presented on the classification of poisonous and nonpoisonous mushrooms. Most of the research works to classify the type of mushroom have applied machine learning techniques like Na√Øve Bayes, K-Neural Network, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree techniques. 	In this task, a summary and comparisons of all different machine learning models of mushroom classification in terms of its performance parameters.
